# Car-Make-Classification

The project aims to create a robust and efficient car classification 
system capable of processing live camera input and providing 
instantaneous predictions on the Year, Model and Make of cars. The 
real-time capabilities of the system make it applicable in various 
domains, including inventory management, crime scene 
investigations, and traffic monitoring.


# Method

The proposed method involves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as the core deep learning architecture for car classification. CNNs consist of multiple layers of convolution and pooling, which enable them to learn hierarchical representations from images, making them powerful for image recognition tasks. The custom dataset, with class-specific folders and angle-specific subfolders, provides a strong foundation for training the CNN model to accurately predict the Year, Model, and Make of cars.
